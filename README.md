# Semantic Framework

## Overview

The **Semantic Framework** is a modular and extensible framework designed to enable semantic transparency and ontology-driven processing for data operations. By leveraging concepts from ontology and context-aware computing, this framework provides tools for managing, processing, and interpreting data in a manner that aligns with predefined semantic rules and contexts.

This framework is particularly suited for applications where:
- **Semantic transparency** is essential for traceable and explainable operations.
- **Ontologies** guide the interpretation of data within well-defined domains.

## Key Features

- **Ontology Integration**: Ensures data processing aligns with domain-specific ontologies, enabling standardized interpretation.
- **Semantic Transparency**: Maintains traceability and clarity for all operations, ensuring outputs are explainable.
- **Modular Architecture**: Facilitates the addition of new data types, operations, and contexts without disrupting the existing structure.
- **Context-Aware Operations**: Incorporates contextual knowledge into data processing workflows, adapting behavior dynamically.
- **Extensibility**: Provides abstract base classes and interfaces for creating custom data types and operations.

## Components

### 1. Data Operations
Abstract classes and tools to define and execute operations on data, ensuring semantic consistency.

### 2. Context Operations
Manage contextual information that influences data processing, enabling adaptive workflows.

### 3. Payload Operations
Handle the execution and orchestration of processing nodes, encapsulating data operations and their associated contexts.

### 4. Data Types
Abstract and concrete implementations for handling different types of data with validation rules.

### 5. Execution Tools
Utility tools to streamline execution, monitoring, and debugging of data pipelines.

This framework was inspired by the need for transparency and traceability in data-driven systems of the ALICE O2 computing system. It incorporates principles of ontology-driven design to ensure robust and interpretable workflows.
